# Number-Plate-Recognization
Number Plate Recognization using Cnn
 The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect and recognize characters from vehicle number plates, enabling seamless data extraction.

Image Preprocessing: The system preprocesses number plate images by resizing, normalizing, and converting them into suitable formats for CNN processing to enhance accuracy and efficiency.
Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping are applied to the dataset to increase its size and robustness, improving the modelâ€™s performance.
CNN Architecture: A deep learning model with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers is designed to extract and classify features from the number plate images accurately.
Interactive GUI: A user-friendly graphical interface is developed using Tkinter, enabling users to upload images, view predictions, and save detected number plate data.
Real-Time Processing: The system is designed for quick and efficient character recognition, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time results.
